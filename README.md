## Solution Setup

Setting up the solution to play the forecasting game:

→ Clone the repository
→ Build database from the edmx model
→ Build and run the web app


## Framework

Target .NET Framework Version: v4.7.2


## Usage

→ Play sports forecast betting while trying to get winnings while iterating through the timemachine.

→ Try not to get broke, but if you do you can always add a wanted amount to your account.

→ You can always get a brand new pairs listing offer when you play all the available items or the timemachine comes to an end.

→ All of your bets and tickets history ( since the databaseb was created ) are recorded and displayed in the tickets menu item.

→ You choose as much pairs as you wish by a ticket each. You can follow your results on the tickets or the bets page as the single bets or tickets red out as they elapse.

→ Choose from the following sports offer: Football, Basketball, Snooker and Tennis; Where team/player pairs are generated by random from the database from a per Sport/Names base with no apparent team/player form/strength being applied to come up with the odds. The odds are completelly random, but once on the board, the resoults are decided by a coeficient driven random outcome.
